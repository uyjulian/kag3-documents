<h1><a id="id86" name="id86">Pass record</a>
</h1><div class="para"><div>
　The passage record is a function that performs auto save at several points so that the user can return to the previous scene by selecting &quot;system-go back&quot;.<br />
<br />
　To record the passage, you need to use the record tag or set <code class="inlinecode">recordHistoryOfStore</code> in Config.tjs.<br />
<br />
　The &quot;System-Back&quot; menu is hidden by default, so it can be displayed by setting <code class="inlinecode">goBackMenuItem.visible</code> to true in Config.tjs.<br />
<br />
　You can also go back and forth by selecting &quot;System-Back&quot;, but the limit can be specified in <code class="inlinecode">maxHistoryOfStore</code> in Config.tjs. Please note that saving too much will make your save data huge. Pass records are stored separately for each bookmark.<br />
<br />
　By the way, please note that it is a different function from &quot;Label Record&quot; which has settings in Config.tjs.<br />
</div></div>
<h1><a id="id87" name="id87">Timing of passage recording</a>
</h1><div class="para"><div>
　By writing a record tag, you can record the current state of the passage. Also, depending on the setting of <code class="inlinecode">recordHistoryOfStore</code> in Config.tjs, it is possible to automatically record passage.<br />
　However, it is not recorded immediately when the record tag is written or at the timing specified in <code class="inlinecode">recordHistoryOfStore</code>. It will be recorded when you pass the next &quot;label that can save bookmarks&quot; (at this point you can go back with &quot;System-Back&quot;). However, what is recorded is the state at the time when it passed the previous &quot;label that can save bookmarks&quot;, and if you select &quot;system-back&quot;, you will return to that position.<br />
</div></div>
<h1><a id="id88" name="id88">position to write record tag</a>
</h1><div class="para"><div>
　It may be easier to set <code class="inlinecode">recordHistoryOfStore</code> for small-scale scenarios and automatically record passages, but for large-scale scenarios, automatically record passages. I think that it is better to write the record tag manually and specify the position where the passage is recorded.<br />
<br />
　If you record a passage, for example, when an option is displayed, the user can select &quot;System-Back&quot; to return to the position of the previous option.<br />
<br />
　In this case, it is OK to write a record tag before the [s] tag to stop at the option. It may be easier to play manually, especially when there are multiple options.<br />
<br />
　If the user selects System-Go Back, he does not return to the position where he wrote the record tag. It returns to the position of &quot;label that can save bookmarks&quot; just before the record tag.<br />
<br />
　By the way, if there is no l, p, s tag between the &quot;label that can save bookmarks&quot; and the next &quot;label that can save bookmarks&quot;, the passing record is It will not be. &quot;System-Back&quot; can be selected only when stopped with l, p, s tags, so if you record a passage where there is no l, p, s tag, you can not go back earlier than that Because<br />
